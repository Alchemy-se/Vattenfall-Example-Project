# Vattenfall-Example-Project

## Step 1

Setup a new Yarn project with 

```sh
yarn init
```

Install the Horizon design system by running

```sh
yarn add @vf-alchemy/vattenfall-design-system
```

Create a new [index.html](./index.html) and fill it with the content from the link.

Open the page in your browser:
```sh
open index.html
```

Great, that should now show a page with a headline using the Horizon title font.
